      &lt;h2&gt;WHISPers 2.0 Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;label class&#x3D;&quot;about-header&quot;&gt; What is WHISPers?&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        WHISPers stands for Wildlife Health Information Sharing Partnership - event reporting system. It is a
        partner-driven, web-based repository for sharing basic information about historic and ongoing wildlife
        mortality (death) and/or morbidity (illness) events. The information, such as county-level locations, onset and
        ending dates, species affected, and diagnosis has generously been shared with the USGS National Wildlife Health
        Center over time by hundreds of natural resource managers and stakeholders across the U.S. and beyond. The
        primary goal of the system is to provide natural resource management partners and the public with timely,
        accurate information on where wildlife disease events are occurring or have occurred for better preparation and
        decision making. The information is opportunistically collected and does not reflect all the mortality events
        that occur in North America. WHISPers is also the portal for requests for diagnostic and epidemiologic
        assistance from the USGS National Wildlife Health Center Diagnostic Laboratory.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;label class&#x3D;&quot;about-header&quot;&gt; What does WHISPers do?&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        WHISPers provides a place and a reporting structure for natural resource managers to enter event information
        and for anyone, including the public, to learn about verified (laboratory diagnosed) wildlife disease events.
        The records in WHISPers can be searched by species, disease, location (to county level), and event starting and
        ending dates.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;label class&#x3D;&quot;about-header&quot;&gt; What’s new in WHISPers 2.0?&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        Historically, information provided by partner agencies was summarized and managed by staff at the USGS National
        Wildlife Health Center. In response to partner needs for more timely understanding of wildlife disease
        occurrence, the new WHISPers will allow authenticated partners to directly enter event information for
        real-time display. They can also share information with colleagues within and across agencies for better
        communication and event response coordination. WHISPers 2.0 is the platform for making diagnostic and
        epidemiologic assistance requests to the USGS National Wildlife Health Center Diagnostic Laboratory.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;label class&#x3D;&quot;about-header&quot;&gt; What is a wildlife &quot;event&quot;?&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        Historically, most events recorded in WHISPers have involved five or more free-ranging wildlife in similar
        geographic space and time but, starting in 2019, morbidity (illness) and/or mortality (death) events are
        defined more loosely to include any noteworthy occurrence of one or more sick or dead animals clustered in
        space and time.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        Morbidity/mortality events can include any or all of the following conditions:
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;trigger cause for concern and warrant reporting by natural resource managers&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;cross political boundaries such as municipal, county, or state lines&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;involve multiple species and/or multiple diagnoses&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;be comprised of individuals with similar clinical signs and/or diagnoses&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;be related to environmental conditions&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;be significant to population(s) of species affected&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;reveal new pathogens, or range or temporal expansion of existing pathogens&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;

      &lt;label class&#x3D;&quot;about-header&quot;&gt; Who can use WHISPers information?&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        Anyone! Basic summary information in WHISPers is provided for anyone interested in knowing more about where
        wildlife disease has occurred. This information is of particular interest for natural resource managers who
        need timely situational awareness of wildlife mortality and/or morbidity events. Knowledge of recent and
        ongoing events affords these professionals the opportunity to (1) proactively monitor for disease in their
        jurisdiction and (2) prepare for and appropriately manage these events. Authenticated agency partners can log
        in and see more detailed information about events they create or those shared with them by colleagues.
        Information on sick and dead wildlife is opportunistically collected and does not reflect all the mortality
        events that occur in North America.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;label class&#x3D;&quot;about-header&quot;&gt; What does it mean to be an authenticated agency partner?&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        Authenticated users at partner natural resource agencies have access to enhanced WHISPers features such as
        the ability to see more detailed event information than the public can see, the ability to enter and update
        event information for their agency, and a communication interface with the USGS National Wildlife Health Center
        and other agencies. Administrators within partner agencies and/or the USGS National Wildlife Health
        Center can authenticate users who want access to these enhanced features.
      &lt;/p&gt;


      &lt;label class&#x3D;&quot;about-header&quot;&gt; Is this a citizen science reporting mechanism?&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        No, information in WHISPers is verified and provided by partner agencies and laboratories. If you are a
        private individual or entity with a mortality event to report, please contact your state department of
        natural resources or state agency of game and fish. A list of state agencies can be at the &lt;a
          href&#x3D;&quot;https://www.fishwildlife.org/landing/membership/member-list&quot;&gt;Association
          of Fish and Wildlife Agencies&lt;/a&gt; website.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;label class&#x3D;&quot;about-header&quot;&gt; What do the colors and shapes on the map mean?&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        The location information in WHISPers is provided at the county level. The circles represent a
        morbidity/mortality disease event and triangles represent surveillance activity, with the circle or
        triangle located at the center of the county. The colors represent different disease categories such as
        bacteria or toxins. The color key is on the map. For counties with multiple events, the color of the
        circle or triangle is gray. The number in the shape equals the number of events recorded in WHISPers
        that have occurred in that county. Clicking on the circle or triangle shows more information on the
        events in that county. The map on the homepage displays disease and surveillance events that started over the
        previous 4 weeks.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;label class&#x3D;&quot;about-header&quot;&gt; Why are there many events in some places and no events in others?&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        The information in WHISPers is collected opportunistically. Sick or dead animals must be observed,
        collected, submitted to a diagnostic laboratory, and the information shared in WHISPers in order to
        appear on the map and in the associated database. Not every mortality event that occurs is observed,
        diagnosed, or reported to WHISPers. Observation and reporting are more likely in very populated areas
        and less likely in sparsely populated locations. Some diseases, such as avian botulism, can occur
        repeatedly in a location. A blank space on the map doesn’t mean wildlife disease has not occurred in
        that location.
        Wildlife agencies, diagnostic laboratories, and other organizations have vast knowledge of mortality
        events in their area but there are technological challenges to sharing the information. A long-term
        goal for WHISPers is to grow the partnership and make it easier for data to be shared.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;label class&#x3D;&quot;about-header&quot;&gt; Why aren&#x27;t all the species diagnoses listed as event diagnoses?&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        WHISPers has diagnoses listed at the species level, documenting diagnostic findings in specimens of
        a particular species at a particular location. Some diagnoses may be an interesting finding in the
        specific animal tested, but not a likely cause of sickness or death.
        WHISPers also has event level diagnoses that represent the overall main reason(s) for illness
        and/or death across all locations and species and thus the major cause(s) of the event, or a
        diagnosis deemed significant enough to list at the event level for situational awareness.
        Event level diagnoses are listed on the main table view of data (e.g., on the home page or in the
        table that results from a search), whereas species level diagnoses can be found by clicking on a
        particular event and looking at each species listed.
        Note: at this point, not all WHISPers events have species level diagnoses provided.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;label class&#x3D;&quot;about-header&quot;&gt; Why is the location information only specific to the county level?&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        In discussions with partners and stakeholders, county level information was felt to be useful for
        providing a general overview of disease occurrence while simultaneously protecting sensitive
        wildlife population information and respecting landowner privacy. Authenticated agency partners
        can log in and see more detailed location information about events they create or those shared
        with them by colleagues.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;label class&#x3D;&quot;about-header&quot;&gt; Why is it important to track wildlife mortality events?&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        Diseases affect wildlife and wildlife populations. Many diseases are quite predictable,
        occurring in the same locations at similar times each year. By chronicling these &quot;typical&quot;
        events, we can develop a better picture of disease impacts on wildlife across North America.
        And with knowledge of &quot;typical&quot; events, it is easier to identify departures from the norm,
        including new species or geographic areas affected by known diseases, or new diseases as they
        emerge and potentially spread across the landscape. A centralized repository of this
        information promotes better awareness of wildlife disease and augments opportunity for both
        proactive and timely reactive response by natural resource managers.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;label class&#x3D;&quot;about-header&quot;&gt; What data are included?&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        WHISPers is designed to store summary or aggregate data from wildlife disease events. Each
        record includes location of the event (to county level), start (when situation is first
        observed or estimated to have begun) and end (when the event is considered to be over) dates,
        species involved, number of sick and dead, cause of wildlife illness or death, the laboratory
        where cause of disease/death was confirmed, and contact information for the agency that
        submitted carcasses/samples to the laboratory.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;label class&#x3D;&quot;about-header&quot;&gt; Where is the information in WHISPers from?&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        This information is from a variety of sources including federal, tribal, and state agencies
        who contacted the USGS National Wildlife Health Center for diagnostic and epidemiological
        assistance during mortality events; diagnostic case reports from other wildlife diagnostic
        laboratories; and published reports in journals, newspapers, or other reporting outlets
        such as &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;http://www.promedmail.org/&quot;&gt;ProMEDmail.org&lt;/a&gt;. Information from newspaper
        and other outlets is verified to the
        best of our ability before inclusion in the database.
        WHISPers does not currently contain much information from designed surveillance programs;
        however, data on select surveillance projects that the USGS National Wildlife Health Center
        has partnered on can be found on our &lt;a
          href&#x3D;&quot;https://www.usgs.gov/centers/nwhc/science/disease-surveillance&quot;&gt;wildlife
          pathogen surveillance websites&lt;/a&gt;. More surveillance information is planned to be added in a future version
        of WHISPers.
        Event information is collected and shared opportunistically and therefore may not be a
        complete representation of what is occurring in wildlife populations in any given time or
        place. Providing a common platform through WHISPers for partners to share wildlife event
        information will increase our collective understanding of when and where diseases occur in
        wildlife.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;label class&#x3D;&quot;about-header&quot;&gt; What is involved in diagnostic laboratory evaluation and testing?&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        Typically, 3-5 freshly dead animals are collected by field biologists and sent to a
        veterinary diagnostic laboratory where they undergo a necropsy, which is a process
        similar to a human autopsy. The process includes a detailed external and internal
        examination by a trained veterinary pathologist. During the necropsy, the pathologist
        selects tissue samples for laboratory testing and to examine under the microscope. The
        pathologist then interprets the test results, microscopic findings, and field information
        (such as sick animal behavior, species biology, environmental factors, and disease
        ecology) to arrive at a diagnosis for the cause of illness or death.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;label class&#x3D;&quot;about-header&quot;&gt; Are events from all types of wildlife recorded?&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        WHISPers contains opportunistically collected general information on mortality and/or
        morbidity events. In the future, it will also contain information on surveillance
        activities. Historically, most events recorded in WHISPers have involved five or more
        free-ranging wildlife in similar geographic space and time but, starting in 2019,
        events are defined more loosely to include any noteworthy occurrence of one or more
        sick or dead animals clustered in space and time. It is not intended to store or track
        health data from wildlife maintained in rehabilitation facilities, zoological
        facilities, and other captive settings. Currently, the majority of the events in
        WHISpers involve wild birds, but it also contains events involving mammals, reptiles,
        amphibians, and sometimes fish. It is anticipated that as the number of participating
        WHISPers partners increases there will be a broader diversity of events.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;label class&#x3D;&quot;about-header&quot;&gt; Who enters data into WHISPers?&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        Currently, the information is entered by staff at the USGS National Wildlife Health
        Center. Future plans include providing authenticated agency partners with the
        capability to enter information about mortality and/or morbidity events directly into
        the system, and be able to edit/update those records as needed.
        Diagnostic facilities, like the USGS National Wildlife Health Center, will also be
        able to enter records, if authorized by a submitting agency partner.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;label class&#x3D;&quot;about-header&quot;&gt;Who created WHISPers?&lt;/label&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        The concept for WHISPers was developed by the USGS National Wildlife Health Center,
        in partnership with federal, state, tribal, non-governmental, and academic
        partners. System software was initially developed by the USGS National Wildlife
        Health Center and then refactored by &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://wim.usgs.gov/&quot;&gt;USGS Web
          Informatics and Mapping&lt;/a&gt;, with funding
        from the Department of Homeland Security’s National Biosurveillance Integration
        Center and USGS Ecosystems Mission Area.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;label class&#x3D;&quot;about-header&quot;&gt; Is this a new idea?&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        For nearly 40 years, the USGS National Wildlife Health Center has been collecting
        and distributing information on wildlife mortality and/or morbidity events.
        Quarterly summaries of these data have been published in the Supplement to the
        Journal of Wildlife Diseases since 1987. These “Quarterly Reports,” dating to
        1981, can be viewed &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://www.usgs.gov/centers/nwhc/science/quarterly-mortality-reports&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
        WHISPers represents a significant upgrade to these
        reports, with tools designed to query, map, sort, and download event data.
        Additionally, with partner input, the new system will provide a more
        comprehensive view of wildlife mortality and/or morbidity events across North
        America. While WHISPers is designed to accommodate partners&#x27; wildlife mortality
        and/or morbidity event data, it is not intended to replicate existing data
        management systems.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;label class&#x3D;&quot;about-header&quot;&gt; Where can I learn more about wildlife diseases in North America?&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        For fact sheets and other information about specific wildlife diseases, you may
        want to visit the USGS National Wildlife Health Center &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://www.usgs.gov/centers/nwhc&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;

      &lt;label class&#x3D;&quot;about-header&quot;&gt; How do I get medical help because I, a family member, or a pet may have been exposed
        to a disease in my county?&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        If you have concerns or questions regarding human or domestic animal health
        risks associated with wildlife diseases, please contact your doctor or
        veterinarian for more information.
      &lt;/p&gt;


      &lt;label class&#x3D;&quot;about-header&quot;&gt; What is a diagnostic or consultative services request?&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        The USGS National Wildlife Health Center (NWHC) is a full service
        diagnostic and research laboratory. Staff work with state, federal, and
        tribal natural resource agencies to provide diagnostic evaluation and
        testing on migratory birds, endangered species, and animals on federal or
        tribal lands. In addition, NWHC epidemiologists help agencies determine
        appropriate disease control strategies for wildlife morbidity and
        mortality events. Staff from natural resource agencies can request
        permission to ship specimens to NWHC for cause of death determination
        (diagnostic request), as well as seek input on responding to disease
        events (consultative services request).
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;label class&#x3D;&quot;about-header&quot;&gt;How do I submit a carcass to the USGS National Wildlife Health Center or request a
        consult?&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        Requests for permission to ship specimens to the USGS National Wildlife
        Health Center (NWHC) can be made by authenticated natural resource
        agency partner users from the event details page. For an urgent
        wildlife disease situation, call NWHC at 608-270-2480; for NWHC Hawaii
        call 808-792-9520. Please do not submit carcasses without contacting
        NWHC first.
        The general public should report sick or dead wildlife to their &lt;a
          href&#x3D;&quot;https://www.fishwildlife.org/landing/membership/member-list&quot;&gt;local
          natural resource agency&lt;/a&gt;.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;label class&#x3D;&quot;about-header&quot;&gt; How do I apply to be a verified or authenticated partner?&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        Staff from state, federal and tribal natural resource agencies can
        request to become an authenticated WHISPers user by submitting a
        request from the WHISPers homepage.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;label class&#x3D;&quot;about-header&quot;&gt; Do I have to create a login?&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        WHISPers is available to anyone to view, search, and download event
        information without creating a login. If general users would like
        to save their search criteria, then creating a login user name and
        password is necessary.
        Authenticated state, federal, and tribal partner users will have to
        create a login in order to enter and edit events, share event
        information with colleagues, and request diagnostic and
        epidemiological assistance from the USGS National WIldlife Health
        Center.

It is a        partner-driven, web-based repository for sharing basic information about historic and ongoing wildlife        mortality (death) and/or morbidity (illness) events. The information, such as county-level locations, onset and        ending dates, species affected, and diagnosis has generously been shared with the USGS National Wildlife Health        Center over time by hundreds of natural resource managers and stakeholders across the U.S. and beyond. The        primary goal of the system is to provide natural resource management partners and the public with timely,        accurate information on where wildlife disease events are occurring or have occurred for better preparation and        decision making. The information is opportunistically collected and does not reflect all the mortality events        that occur in North America. WHISPers is also the portal for requests for diagnostic and epidemiologic        assistance from the USGS National Wildlife Health Center Diagnostic Laboratory.      </p>      <label class="about-header"> What does WHISPers do?</label>      <p>        WHISPers provides a place and a reporting structure for natural resource managers to enter event information        and for anyone, including the public, to learn about verified (laboratory diagnosed) wildlife disease events.        The records in WHISPers can be searched by species, disease, location (to county level), and event starting and        ending dates.      </p>      <label class="about-header"> What’s new in WHISPers 2.0?</label>      <p>        Historically, information provided by partner agencies was summarized and managed by staff at the USGS National        Wildlife Health Center. In response to partner needs for more timely understanding of wildlife disease        occurrence, the new WHISPers will allow authenticated partners to directly enter event information for        real-time display. They can also share information with colleagues within and across agencies for better        communication and event response coordination. WHISPers 2.0 is the platform for making diagnostic and        epidemiologic assistance requests to the USGS National Wildlife Health Center Diagnostic Laboratory.      </p>      <label class="about-header"> What is a wildlife "event"?</label>      <p>        Historically, most events recorded in WHISPers have involved five or more free-ranging wildlife in similar        geographic space and time but, starting in 2019, morbidity (illness) and/or mortality (death) events are        defined more loosely to include any noteworthy occurrence of one or more sick or dead animals clustered in        space and time.      </p>      <p>        Morbidity/mortality events can include any or all of the following conditions:      </p>      <ul>        <li>trigger cause for concern and warrant reporting by natural resource managers</li>        <li>cross political boundaries such as municipal, county, or state lines</li>        <li>involve multiple species and/or multiple diagnoses</li>        <li>be comprised of individuals with similar clinical signs and/or diagnoses</li>        <li>be related to environmental conditions</li>        <li>be significant to population(s) of species affected</li>        <li>reveal new pathogens, or range or temporal expansion of existing pathogens</li>      </ul>      <label class="about-header"> Who can use WHISPers information?</label>      <p>        Anyone! Basic summary information in WHISPers is provided for anyone interested in knowing more about where        wildlife disease has occurred. This information is of particular interest for natural resource managers who        need timely situational awareness of wildlife mortality and/or morbidity events. Knowledge of recent and        ongoing events affords these professionals the opportunity to (1) proactively monitor for disease in their        jurisdiction and (2) prepare for and appropriately manage these events. Authenticated agency partners can log        in and see more detailed information about events they create or those shared with them by colleagues.        Information on sick and dead wildlife is opportunistically collected and does not reflect all the mortality        events that occur in North America.      </p>      <label class="about-header"> What does it mean to be an authenticated agency partner?</label>      <p>        Authenticated users at partner natural resource agencies have access to enhanced WHISPers features such as        the ability to see more detailed event information than the public can see, the ability to enter and update        event information for their agency, and a communication interface with the USGS National Wildlife Health Center        and other agencies. Administrators within partner agencies and/or the USGS National Wildlife Health        Center can authenticate users who want access to these enhanced features.      </p>      <label class="about-header"> Is this a citizen science reporting mechanism?</label>      <p>        No, information in WHISPers is verified and provided by partner agencies and laboratories. If you are a        private individual or entity with a mortality event to report, please contact your state department of        natural resources or state agency of game and fish. A list of state agencies can be at the <a          href="https://www.fishwildlife.org/landing/membership/member-list">Association          of Fish and Wildlife Agencies</a> website.      </p>      <label class="about-header"> What do the colors and shapes on the map mean?</label>      <p>        The location information in WHISPers is provided at the county level. The circles represent a        morbidity/mortality disease event and triangles represent surveillance activity, with the circle or        triangle located at the center of the county. The colors represent different disease categories such as        bacteria or toxins. The color key is on the map. For counties with multiple events, the color of the        circle or triangle is gray. The number in the shape equals the number of events recorded in WHISPers        that have occurred in that county. Clicking on the circle or triangle shows more information on the        events in that county. The map on the homepage displays disease and surveillance events that started over the        previous 4 weeks.      </p>      <label class="about-header"> Why are there many events in some places and no events in others?</label>      <p>        The information in WHISPers is collected opportunistically. Sick or dead animals must be observed,        collected, submitted to a diagnostic laboratory, and the information shared in WHISPers in order to        appear on the map and in the associated database. Not every mortality event that occurs is observed,        diagnosed, or reported to WHISPers. Observation and reporting are more likely in very populated areas        and less likely in sparsely populated locations. Some diseases, such as avian botulism, can occur        repeatedly in a location. A blank space on the map doesn’t mean wildlife disease has not occurred in        that location.        Wildlife agencies, diagnostic laboratories, and other organizations have vast knowledge of mortality        events in their area but there are technological challenges to sharing the information. A long-term        goal for WHISPers is to grow the partnership and make it easier for data to be shared.      </p>      <label class="about-header"> Why aren\'t all the species diagnoses listed as event diagnoses?</label>      <p>        WHISPers has diagnoses listed at the species level, documenting diagnostic findings in specimens of        a particular species at a particular location. Some diagnoses may be an interesting finding in the        specific animal tested, but not a likely cause of sickness or death.        WHISPers also has event level diagnoses that represent the overall main reason(s) for illness        and/or death across all locations and species and thus the major cause(s) of the event, or a        diagnosis deemed significant enough to list at the event level for situational awareness.        Event level diagnoses are listed on the main table view of data (e.g., on the home page or in the        table that results from a search), whereas species level diagnoses can be found by clicking on a        particular event and looking at each species listed.        Note: at this point, not all WHISPers events have species level diagnoses provided.      </p>      <label class="about-header"> Why is the location information only specific to the county level?</label>      <p>        In discussions with partners and stakeholders, county level information was felt to be useful for        providing a general overview of disease occurrence while simultaneously protecting sensitive        wildlife population information and respecting landowner privacy. Authenticated agency partners        can log in and see more detailed location information about events they create or those shared        with them by colleagues.      </p>      <label class="about-header"> Why is it important to track wildlife mortality events?</label>      <p>        Diseases affect wildlife and wildlife populations. Many diseases are quite predictable,        occurring in the same locations at similar times each year. By chronicling these "typical"        events, we can develop a better picture of disease impacts on wildlife across North America.        And with knowledge of "typical" events, it is easier to identify departures from the norm,        including new species or geographic areas affected by known diseases, or new diseases as they        emerge and potentially spread across the landscape. A centralized repository of this        information promotes better awareness of wildlife disease and augments opportunity for both        proactive and timely reactive response by natural resource managers.      </p>      <label class="about-header"> What data are included?</label>      <p>        WHISPers is designed to store summary or aggregate data from wildlife disease events. Each        record includes location of the event (to county level), start (when situation is first        observed or estimated to have begun) and end (when the event is considered to be over) dates,        species involved, number of sick and dead, cause of wildlife illness or death, the laboratory        where cause of disease/death was confirmed, and contact information for the agency that        submitted carcasses/samples to the laboratory.      </p>      <label class="about-header"> Where is the information in WHISPers from?</label>      <p>        This information is from a variety of sources including federal, tribal, and state agencies        who contacted the USGS National Wildlife Health Center for diagnostic and epidemiological        assistance during mortality events; diagnostic case reports from other wildlife diagnostic        laboratories; and published reports in journals, newspapers, or other reporting outlets        such as <a href="http://www.promedmail.org/">ProMEDmail.org</a>. Information from newspaper        and other outlets is verified to the        best of our ability before inclusion in the database.        WHISPers does not currently contain much information from designed surveillance programs;        however, data on select surveillance projects that the USGS National Wildlife Health Center        has partnered on can be found on our <a          href="https://www.usgs.gov/centers/nwhc/science/disease-surveillance">wildlife          pathogen surveillance websites</a>. More surveillance information is planned to be added in a future version        of WHISPers.        Event information is collected and shared opportunistically and therefore may not be a        complete representation of what is occurring in wildlife populations in any given time or        place. Providing a common platform through WHISPers for partners to share wildlife event        information will increase our collective understanding of when and where diseases occur in        wildlife.      </p>      <label class="about-header"> What is involved in diagnostic laboratory evaluation and testing?</label>      <p>        Typically, 3-5 freshly dead animals are collected by field biologists and sent to a        veterinary diagnostic laboratory where they undergo a necropsy, which is a process        similar to a human autopsy. The process includes a detailed external and internal        examination by a trained veterinary pathologist. During the necropsy, the pathologist        selects tissue samples for laboratory testing and to examine under the microscope. The        pathologist then interprets the test results, microscopic findings, and field information        (such as sick animal behavior, species biology, environmental factors, and disease        ecology) to arrive at a diagnosis for the cause of illness or death.      </p>      <label class="about-header"> Are events from all types of wildlife recorded?</label>      <p>        WHISPers contains opportunistically collected general information on mortality and/or        morbidity events. In the future, it will also contain information on surveillance        activities. Historically, most events recorded in WHISPers have involved five or more        free-ranging wildlife in similar geographic space and time but, starting in 2019,        events are defined more loosely to include any noteworthy occurrence of one or more        sick or dead animals clustered in space and time. It is not intended to store or track        health data from wildlife maintained in rehabilitation facilities, zoological        facilities, and other captive settings. Currently, the majority of the events in        WHISpers involve wild birds, but it also contains events involving mammals, reptiles,        amphibians, and sometimes fish. It is anticipated that as the number of participating        WHISPers partners increases there will be a broader diversity of events.      </p>      <label class="about-header"> Who enters data into WHISPers?</label>      <p>        Currently, the information is entered by staff at the USGS National Wildlife Health        Center. Future plans include providing authenticated agency partners with the        capability to enter information about mortality and/or morbidity events directly into        the system, and be able to edit/update those records as needed.        Diagnostic facilities, like the USGS National Wildlife Health Center, will also be        able to enter records, if authorized by a submitting agency partner.      </p>      <label class="about-header">Who created WHISPers?</label>      <p>        The concept for WHISPers was developed by the USGS National Wildlife Health Center,        in partnership with federal, state, tribal, non-governmental, and academic        partners. System software was initially developed by the USGS National Wildlife        Health Center and then refactored by <a href="https://wim.usgs.gov/">USGS Web          Informatics and Mapping</a>, with funding        from the Department of Homeland Security’s National Biosurveillance Integration        Center and USGS Ecosystems Mission Area.      </p>      <label class="about-header"> Is this a new idea?</label>      <p>        For nearly 40 years, the USGS National Wildlife Health Center has been collecting        and distributing information on wildlife mortality and/or morbidity events.        Quarterly summaries of these data have been published in the Supplement to the        Journal of Wildlife Diseases since 1987. These “Quarterly Reports,” dating to        1981, can be viewed <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/centers/nwhc/science/quarterly-mortality-reports">here</a>.        WHISPers represents a significant upgrade to these        reports, with tools designed to query, map, sort, and download event data.        Additionally, with partner input, the new system will provide a more        comprehensive view of wildlife mortality and/or morbidity events across North        America.

Staff work with state, federal, and        tribal natural resource agencies to provide diagnostic evaluation and        testing on migratory birds, endangered species, and animals on federal or        tribal lands. In addition, NWHC epidemiologists help agencies determine        appropriate disease control strategies for wildlife morbidity and        mortality events. Staff from natural resource agencies can request        permission to ship specimens to NWHC for cause of death determination        (diagnostic request), as well as seek input on responding to disease        events (consultative services request).      </p>      <label class="about-header">How do I submit a carcass to the USGS National Wildlife Health Center or request a        consult?</label>      <p>        Requests for permission to ship specimens to the USGS National Wildlife        Health Center (NWHC) can be made by authenticated natural resource        agency partner users from the event details page.
