Information Sharing Partnership event reporting system. WHISPers allows users to enter, discover, and explore wildlife mortality data submitted by partners across North America and verified by trained biologists.\nThis project was built with Angular and generated with Angular CLI. It also relies on Leaflet, OpenStreetMap, NgxMatSelectSearch and the USGS Search API.\nInstallation\nPrerequisite: Please install Angular-CLI by following these instructions.\ngit clone https://github.com/USGS-WiM/whispers.git\ncd whispers\ninstall the project's dependencies\nnpm install\nNote: It is best to run npm install at least three times as it often takes several runs to successfully install all dependencies. \nEnvironments\nThe three main environments are configured by environment files found at /src/enviroments/. The API / web services root URL for each environment is stored in these files. Default environment is development at environment.ts, used by the development server (see below).  Test environment at environment.test.ts is used by the test build (see below). Production environment at environment.prod.tsis used by the production build (see below).\nDevelopment server for active development\nRun ng serve for a dev server with live reload. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. This will use the development environment configuration (environment.ts).\nAngular code scaffolding\nThe Angular CLI offers a generate tool that makes the creation of some common component types a little easier.\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate  directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nDistribution build for test and production\nWhen publishing the WHISPers app on the server for either the test phase or the final publishing to production level, a developer must run the Angular CLI build script to create a minimized, optimized package for server distribution. WHISPers has two build configurations: test and production. \nTest\nTo be used when a new release version is ready for cooperator review but not yet ready for production. \nRun ng build --configuration=test --base-href [relative path to web server root] to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. This will use the test environment configuration.\nProduction\nTo be used when a release version has passed the testing phase by receiving approval for promotion by the cooperator. \nRun ng build --prod --base-href [relative path to web server root] to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. This will use the production environment configuration.\nNote: the main differences between these two configurations are 1) the API root (prod services/database vs test services/database) and 2) the inclusion of Google Analytics for the production configuration. \nAuthors\n\nBlake Draper - Lead Developer - USGS Web Informatics & Mapping\n\n\nNick Estes - Developer - USGS Web Informatics & Mapping\n\n\nLauren Privette - Developer - USGS Web Informatics & Mapping\n\n\nMitch Samuels - Designer/Developer - USGS Web Informatics & Mapping\n\nSee also the list of contributors who participated in this project.\nLicense\nThis software is in the Public Domain.
